--need to include any evidence here and push near 1.0 for PSL framework to work. 
For instance, the correlation is small but significant for BRAF -> RAF1, and there is
some similarity in both goCC and goBP. I'll need to threshold values above a small number to something like
0.9 for the learner to work, and maybe formulate a new rule that considers similarity
in both. Also, symmetric values prot2prot, etc need to be considered, and influences is also symmetric
as we can add on the directionality later in post-processing
